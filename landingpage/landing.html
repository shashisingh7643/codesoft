      <h2>History</h2>
      <h4>The Himalayas, the world's youngest and highest mountain range,
         were formed some 50 million years ago as a result of the monumental 
         collision between the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates. With their towering peaks,
          these mountains have been a cradle of diverse cultures and religions, playing a central 
          role in the development of Hinduism and Buddhism. This region has witnessed the footprints of ancient trade 
          routes, spiritual pilgrims, and pioneering explorers, culminating in the historic first ascent of Mount Everest in 1953.
           Today, the Himalayas remain ecologically critical, harboring unique flora and fauna while serving as the source of major rivers that sustain millions 
           of people in the Indian subcontinent. However, modern challenges, including climate change and habitat degradation, pose significant threats to this majestic 
           and culturally rich landscape, making conservation efforts vital for the Himalayas' future.</h4><br/>
      <p>Here are the key Features :</p>

      <ol>
        <li><b>Geological Formation:</b>
        <ul>
            <li>The Himalayan mountain range was formed as a result of the collision between the Indian tectonic plate and the Eurasian tectonic plate around 50 million years ago during the Cenozoic Era.</li>
            <li>This collision caused the Earth's crust to buckle and fold, resulting in the uplift of the Himalayan range.</li>
            <li>The Himalayas continue to rise at a rate of a few millimeters per year due to ongoing tectonic activity.</li>
        </ul>
        </li><br/>
        
        <li><b>Cultural Significance:</b>
          <ul>
            <li>The Himalayas have been home to diverse cultures and civilizations for thousands of years. Ancient trade routes, such as the Silk Road, passed through this region.</li>
            <li>The Himalayas have played a central role in the development of Hinduism and Buddhism. They are associated with numerous sacred sites and have been a destination for pilgrims and spiritual seekers.</li>
            <li>The region has a rich history of monasteries, temples, and ancient settlements that reflect the cultural and religious diversity of the area.</li>

              <li>The British surveyor Sir George Everest conducted the first systematic survey of the Himalayas in the 19th century.</li>
               <li>The Himalayas became a focal point for mountaineering, with the first successful ascent of Mount Everest by Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay in 1953.</li>
            </ul>
          </li><br/>

          <li><b>Ecological Importance:</b>
            <ul>
              <li>The Himalayas are a biodiversity hotspot, home to a wide range of flora and fauna, including the elusive snow leopard, Bengal tiger, and various species of rhinoceros.</li>
              <li>The region is the source of many major rivers, including the Ganges, Brahmaputra, and Indus, which provide water for millions of people in the Indian subcontinent.</li>
           <li>The Himalayas are crucial for regulating the climate and water resources of the entire region.</li>
